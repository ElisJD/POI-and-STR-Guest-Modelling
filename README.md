# POI and Short Term Rental Guest Modelling

This project analyses short term rental (STR) listing patterns and guest behaviour in London and Edinburgh, integrating POI (Point of Interest) data to enhance predictive modelling.

The project is for my dissertation for the MSc Geographic Data Science course at the University of Liverpool.

This work is under the supervision of Dr. Olga Gkountouna (academic supervisor), and Chris Vardy, and Callum Scooby from Geolytix as this dissertation is provided through the CDRC's Masters Dissertation Scheme.
